# FDH-Jerusalem
Project Jerusalem: locating the colonies and neighborhoods for Foundation of Digital Humanities course 2022

Notebook 'data_collection&preprocessing' records the process we get the original source and the way we process them. After fuzzy match, we correct the results manually and stored as total_list_permatch_3.0.

To run the project, please first set the Mysql database locally.
Then:
1. Run build_db.py to build the database.
2. Run app.py and open the website.
